A local court on Monday issued bailable arrest warrant against former Minister Perni Venkataramaiah (Nani) in a case.
In 2019, the Krishna district police had registered a case against a few youth who were involved in a clash, in which the former Minister was a witness.
As Mr. Nani was not attending the court to submit the evidence, the court issued the warrant on Monday, and directed the police to produce him in the court for the next hearing.
