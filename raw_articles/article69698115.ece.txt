In an effort to enhance women’s healthcare in rural communities, a state-of-the-art digital mammography equipment was donated on Thursday to St. Thomas Hospital in Chennai. The initiative, valued at ₹52 lakhs, aims to eliminate delays in cancer detection among women, particularly in the rural areas surrounding the hospital. Free breast screening was provided for the first 75 women who registered, through the newly inaugurated digital mammography equipment. It was inaugurated by Rotary district 3234 governor N. S. Saravanan, along with president of Rotary Club of Madras East P. Muthu and others.
