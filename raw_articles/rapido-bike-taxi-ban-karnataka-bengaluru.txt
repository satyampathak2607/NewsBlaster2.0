Just days before the Karnataka HC announced a complete ban on bikeâ¯taxis, a troubling incident in Bengaluruâs Jayanagar stirred fresh public concern.
A video showing a Rapido bikeâtaxi driver allegedly slapping a female passenger during a heated dispute as she questioned his rash driving has gone viral, prompting outrage and renewed debate over safety, regulation, and accountability on two-wheeler apps.
Jayanagar police have taken cognisance of the incident and confirmed that an investigation is underway.
On June 14, a routine bike-taxi ride in Bengaluruâs Jayanagar took a disturbing turn when a woman accused her Rapido driver of reckless driving and jumping traffic signals.
The confrontation reportedly escalated quickly. According to police sources cited byIndia Today, the rider and passenger got into a heated argument, which soon turned physical.
A video, filmed by a passerby, shows the Rapido driver slapping the woman hard enough to knock her to the ground. Several people are seen standing nearby as the incident unfolds, but no one immediately intervenes.
Initially, the woman was hesitant to report the assault, but police later confirmed she was persuaded to file a formal complaint.
An NCR (Non-Cognizable Report) was registered. However, with the video now widely shared on social media, officials are reportedly considering converting it into a full-fledged FIR.
The incident is currently being investigated by the Jayanagar Police Station, under whose jurisdiction the area falls.

Meanwhile, the driverâidentified as Suhasâshared his version of events withIndia Today.He claimed the woman was rude from the beginning and that he had only taken a shortcut through Jayanagar to save her time.
âShe kept questioning me, asking what I had studied and whether I even knew how to drive,â he said.
According to Suhas, a car blocked their way unexpectedly, and he stopped about 100 metres from her office. Thatâs when she allegedly began shouting and demanded to know the fare. âI told her it was Rs 77,â he said. âShe raised her voice and hit me with a tiffin box. I held my patience as much as I could.â
âI know we shouldnât hit women,â he continued. âBut after she hit me twice and shouted, I hit her once.â
Suhas also admitted to telling her to âgo back to your state,â explaining that he doesnât speak English well. He added that he tried to explain the situation to the store manager nearby, but couldnât find them. âI explained to whoever was there that she raised her hand at me first,â he said.
The viral video of the alleged assault emerged just days before the Karnataka High Court refused to stay a previous directive halting bikeâtaxi services, leading the state government to enforce a complete ban.
Transport Minister Ramalinga Reddy made it clear that using privately registered twoâwheelers for commercial purposes is illegal. He emphasised that the High Court found bike taxis were operating without the necessary licences or regulatory approvals.
Rapido, one of the leading ride-hailing platforms offering bike taxi services in the city, has since responded to the directive. The company announced that it has “paused” its bike taxi operations and introduced a replacement service called âBike Parcelâ.
In an official statement, Rapido said: âStarting June 16, 2025, our bike taxi services in Karnataka will be paused in compliance with recent High Court orders. While we deeply believe in the value bike taxis bring to daily commuters, we respect the law and will fully abide by the directive."
“We remain committed to the communities we serve and are hopeful for a future where convenient, affordable mobility is accessible to all. We are navigating the way forward with the government to bring your favourite bike taxis back on the road soon,â it added.
Interestingly, while Rapido has taken its bike taxis off the streets, other major players such as Uber and Ola were still showing bike taxi options on their apps as of Monday morning, although the waiting times were significantly longer than usual.
Reddy has warned that the government will take strict action against any aggregator that fails to comply with the ban, effective from June 16.
Ahead of the ban, the Namma Bike Taxi Association had written to CM Siddaramaiah and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, urging them to intervene and stop the move, warning that it would adversely affect thousands of gig workers across the state.
Many commuters also feel the decision is a step backwards. They argue that bike taxis have become an essential part of Bengaluruâs daily commute, especially when it comes to affordable and quick first-and-last-mile connectivity amid the city’s traffic and patchy public transport.
