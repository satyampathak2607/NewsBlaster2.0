The Ernakulam district administration on Monday (June 16, 2025) informed the Kerala High Court that restoration work on the Mullassery Canal was progressing, albeit with some delays.
The submission was made by Senior Government Pleader S. Kannan before Justice Devan Ramachandran when petitions seeking to prevent flooding in Kochi city came up for hearing. He said the delay was due to reasons beyond the control of the district administration.
The court observed that it was pleased to hear the inundation of the city had been under control over the past two days despite heavy rain. While this augured well for the city, the authorities must ensure that efforts to prevent flooding continue without any impediments.
Counsel for the Kochi Corporation submitted that desilting work in the city was nearing completion. Counsel for the Railways submitted that it had granted the Corporation permission to desilt 23 culverts under its control, of which the cleaning of 15 had been completed.
