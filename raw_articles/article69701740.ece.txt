The forest officials on Monday shifted the leopard rescued from the outskirts of Adoni to Sri Venkateswara Zoological Park at Tirupati for better medical care.
The leopard was found near the Basannagutta forest area in Kosigi mandal on Sunday evening (June 15) by farmers who alerted the Adoni range forest officials.
Forest officials said that the leopard was growling with pain and was not moving by the time they reached the spot. It was tranquilised and shifted to Adoni forest office. A bone was stuck in the throat of the leopard and it was removed.
Officials said that the rescue team of Nagarjuna Sagar Tiger Reserve provided first aid and suggested that the wild cat be shifted to Tirupati zoo for better treatment. On the advice of the rescue team, the leopard was shifted to the zoo.
On the occasion, the forest officials asked people not to panic with the movement of leopards in human habitations and asked them to inform the forest officials if they notice any wild animal movement.
