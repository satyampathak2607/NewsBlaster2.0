In a dramatic turn of events, J. J. Nagar Police on Sunday opened fire and nabbed two accused who were on the run after stabbing a 26-year-old man to death hours after he was released on bail from Parappana Agrahara Central Prison on Saturday.
The accused Deepu, 28 and Arun, 27 were allegedly hiding in a forest area in R. R. Nagar, when the police went to nab them. They allegedly assaulted police officials, following which police claimed to have shot in the air as warning and later shot at their legs and arrested them. Both are being treated at a hospital.
The duo had on Saturday late night stabbed Vijay, owner of a footwear store in Kalasipalya, to death. A few months ago, Arun and Vijay had a bitter fight, during which Vijay had stabbed Arun. While Arun survived the attack, Kalasipalya Police arrested Vijay, booking him for attempt to murder. He was released on bail in the case from Parappana Agrahara Central Prison on Saturday.
Hours later Arun, along with his associate Deepu, confronted Vijay in Janata colony in J. J. Nagar and stabbed him multiple times after a heated argument. The profusely bleeding Vijay was rushed to the hospital where he succumbed to his death hours later.
J. J. Nagar Police who took up the investigation into the murder case, tracked down Arun and Deepu, to a forested area in R. R. Nagar where they had been hiding after stabbing Vijay to death hours earlier. The police started a combing operation and made an announcement warning the duo to surrender. However, the duo attacked police personnel in an attempt to flee, following which they were shot at, police claimed.
The duo has been booked for not only murder, but also for assaulting government servants while on duty.
