As tensions between Israel and Iran reach a boiling point, thousands of Indian students in Iran now find themselves in an increasingly dangerous and uncertain situation.
Most of these students, many of whom are pursuing medical degrees, are growing anxious by the day. With the situation worsening, they are now pleading with the Indian government to arrange their evacuation before things take a turn for the worse.
The latest round of violence began when Israel launched “Operation Rising Lion”, a surprise attack early Friday that reportedly took out key figures in Iran’s military leadership and damaged nuclear infrastructure.
In response, Iran launched a wave of airstrikes. In just four days, the two sides have exchanged hundreds of missiles. While Israel has signalled that it plans to ramp up its campaign further, Iran has vowed to “open the gates of hell” in retaliation.
Amid this chaos, the Indian Embassy has stepped in to provide support, relocating students to safer areas and sharing regular advisories, but the uncertainty is far from over.
Hereâs a closer look at how the crisis is unfolding for Indian students on the ground.
Indian students across Iranian cities like Tehran, Shiraz, and Qom are going through sleepless nights, rattled by the sound of explosions and the constant fear of what might happen next.
âOne blast happened just 5 kilometres from our hostel. Over 350 Indian students are enrolled here. Weâre terrified,â said Imtisal Mohidin, a third-year MBBS student at Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran, speaking toANI.
âWe havenât slept in three daysâ¦ I woke up at 2:30 am to loud explosions and rushed to the basement,â he added. His university has now suspended classes as the situation worsens.
Several students have reported blasts going off alarmingly close to where they live, with some taking shelter in basements to stay safe.
âWe are stuck inside our apartment basement. We hear blasts every night. One of the explosions was just 5 km away. We haven’t slept in three days," Mohidin said. He hails from Jammu and Kashmirâs Kupwara district.
“We request the Government of India to evacuate us before the situation worsens. The Embassy has shared helplines and is in touch, but we are frightened and need to go home,” he said.
Faizan Nabi, a first-year medical student at Kerman University of Medical Sciences, said that fear has now reached even the relatively quieter cities.
âWe heard gunshots in our city today. My friends in Tehran are terrified. We were advised to store drinking water for 3â4 days. Thatâs how bad it is,â he said.
Faizan, who is from Srinagar, toldANIthat his family is constantly worried.
âIâve been getting 10 calls a day from my parents. The internet is so slow that I canât even send a WhatsApp message quickly,â he said. âWe came here to become doctors. Now weâre just trying to stay alive.â
According to an official source cited byThe Hindu, there are currently around 10,000 Indian nationals living in Iran. Of them, more than 6,000 are students, most pursuing medicine from Jammu and Kashmir.
The source told the paper that besides students, the Indian population also includes around 2,000 fisherfolk and sailors working in Iranâs southern ports, and a number of long-settled business families.
According to anNDTVreport, Indian students in Tehran are being evacuated to the city of Qom, 148 km away, as the situation escalates.
This comes after the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Monday said that it is keeping a close watch on the ground situation and working to ensure the safety of all Indian citizens in the region.
MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, in a statement posted on X, said: âThe Indian Embassy in Tehran is continuously monitoring the security situation and engaging Indian students in Iran to ensure their safety.â
He added, âIn some cases, students are being relocated with the Embassyâs facilitation to safer places within Iran. Other feasible options are also under examination.â

The Embassy is also coordinating with local Indian community leaders across Iran to stay updated and offer necessary assistance.
Meanwhile, it has issued anadvisoryasking all Indian nationals and Persons of Indian Origin in Iran to remain alert and avoid unnecessary travel.
The advisory, posted on its X handle, included a Google Form for individuals to register their details for communication and updates.
âPlease remember, it is important not to panic, exercise due caution and maintain contact with the Embassy of India in Tehran,â the statement read.
The Embassy also provided a Telegram link specifically for Indian citizens currently in Iran to receive real-time updates. âKindly note that this Telegram Link is ONLY for those Indian Nationals who are currently in Iran,â it said.
J&K CM Omar Abdullah also said he spoke to S Jaishankar and was in touch with the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on the evolving situation.

India has initiated discussions with Iran regarding the safe evacuation of its nationals. In response, Iran has assured that all land borders are open, even though the countryâs airspace remains closed amid ongoing tensions.
“Given the current condition and the closure of the country’s airports, as well as the request of many political missions to transfer their diplomats and nationals abroad, we inform that all land borders are open for crossing,” Iranian authorities said.
Iranâs Foreign Ministry has also assured full cooperation and agreed to support Indiaâs evacuation efforts.
They have requested that India provide specific details of individuals who will be crossing the borderânames, passport numbers, vehicle details, and intended time and location of border crossingâso arrangements can be made in advance.
With the situation evolving rapidly, Indian authorities are actively assessing options to ensure that every citizen can be safely brought home.
