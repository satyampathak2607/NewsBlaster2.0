Tensions flared between CPI(M) and Congress workers after a Congress mandalam president defected to the CPI(M) at Kottayi, near here, on Monday, sparking a scuffle over control of the Congress office. The clash ensued when former Congress leader Mohan Kumar attempted to seize the office along with his followers.
Mr. Mohan Kumar joined the CPI(M) along with 13 other Congress workers by accepting membership from CPI(M) district secretary E.N. Suresh Babu on Monday. Following the defection, Mr. Mohan Kumar and others opened the Congress office and put up CPI(M) flags.
However, tension erupted as Congress workers tried to prevent the CPI(M) move. the police resorted to a lathicharge to disperse the Congress and CPI(M) workers. One CPI(M) worker was injured in the police action.
Mr. Mohan Kumar had drawn an agreement with the owner of the building that houses the Congress office soon after he quit the party. He reportedly cleared the office rent arrears and made a fresh agreement in his name. He laid claim on the office on the basis of the new agreement.
But Congress workers claimed that the office was functioning for about 100 years, and the lease agreement would usually be in the name of the mandalam president. They insisted that the party office could not be given away when the mandalam president leaves the party.
The police closed the office and left the decision to the Revenue Divisional Officer.
