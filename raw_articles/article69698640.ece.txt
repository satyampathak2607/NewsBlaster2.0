A man and a woman sleeping on the pavement near a temple in Chintalkunta, LB Nagar, were electrocuted to death after a high-tension electricity wire snapped and fell on them in the early hours of Sunday. A street dog, which was also sleeping close to the couple, died in this mishap.
The victims, who are yet to be identified but are believed to be homeless, were sleeping along the Sagar Ring Road when the live wire came down, leading to their immediate death, said an officer from the LB Nagar police.
The LB Nagar police registered a case and shifted the bodies to Osmania General Hospital for a post-mortem examination. Officials from the electricity department inspected the scene and have launched an inquiry into the cause of the accident.
