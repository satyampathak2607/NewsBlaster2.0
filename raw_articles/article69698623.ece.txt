Two unidentified individuals, a man and a woman, swapped a genuine gold ring with a fake one at the Malabar Gold and Diamonds showroom in Panjagutta on May 31. The incident, which went unnoticed at the time, came to light during a recent audit conducted by the showroom staff.
Upon reviewing CCTV footage from the day of the incident, the management found that the duo had discreetly exchanged a 6-gram gold ring before leaving the premises. The matter was immediately reported to the Panjagutta Police. A case has been registered, and investigators are analysing CCTV footage around the store in an effort to identify and trace the duo.
